# Lab Report 3
## PART 1
**A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test**
```
@Test
    public void testFilterFail() {
        List<String> input = new ArrayList<String>();
        input.add("a");
        input.add("b");
        input.add("c"); 
        StringChecker sc = new StringCheck();

        List<String> actualOutput = ListExamples.filter(input, sc);

        List<String> expectedOutput = new ArrayList<String>();
        expectedOutput.add("a");
        expectedOutput.add("b");

        assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);
    }
```

**An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test**
```
@Test
    public void testFilterSuccess() {
        List<String> input = new ArrayList<String>();
        input.add("a");
        input.add("a");
        StringChecker sc = new StringCheck();

        List<String> actualOutput = ListExamples.filter(input, sc);

        List<String> expectedOutput = new ArrayList<String>();
        expectedOutput.add("a");
        expectedOutput.add("a");

        assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);
    }
```

**The symptom, as the output of running the tests**

**The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it**  
original buggy code
```
static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(0, s); <-- BUG
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
```
fixed code
```
static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String s : list) {
      if (sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(s); <-- FIXED
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

**Command-line option 1: grep -m num**

What it's doing and why it's useful: This command stops searching for a phrase in the given file(s) once it has printed out the number of instances of the phrase that has been specified by the user. This can be useful when users only want to look for a few instances of a phrase instead of every isntance.  
Source: man grep  

**Command-line option 2: grep -L**  
example 1:
```
(base) Nishithas-MacBook-Air:docsearch nishi$ grep -L "September" technical/911report/*.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt
```
example 2:
```
(base) Nishithas-MacBook-Air:docsearch nishi$ grep -L "environment" technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/*.txt
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctf7-10.txt
```
What it's doing and why it's useful: This command only prints the names of files that do not have a given phrase. This can be useful in a situation where the user needs to filter out files that do not contain a key phrase in order to improve efficiency.  
Source: man grep  

**Command-line option 3: grep -B num**  
example 1:
```
(base) Nishithas-MacBook-Air:docsearch nishi$ grep -B 2 "Earth" technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/*.txt
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/final.txt-SO2 and NOx. Acidic deposition or "acid rain" occurs when SO2 and

```
What it's doing and why it's useful: This command takes in a key phrase and a number of lines, n. Then, it prints out the line with the key phrase as well as n lines before the key phrase. This can be useful when users would like some context about the lines that the grep command prints out.  
Source: man grep  

**Command-line option 4: grep -n**  
example 1:
```
(base) Nishithas-MacBook-Air:docsearch nishi$ grep -n "Earth" technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/*.txt

example 2:

```
What it's doing and why it's useful: This command prints out the lines in the given files that contain a certain key phrase along with the corresponding line numbers. This can be useful when the user goes into the files where the key phrase has been found since they can easily find where the key phrase is located.
